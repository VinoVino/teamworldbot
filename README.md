## Team World project for 3308

### Title:

Emojicryptor / Emojify

### Team:
James Covino, Cody Hegwer, Annie Lydens

### Vision statement:

Provide a web interface for users to send encrypted "emoji" messages to friends. At a bare minimum we will be able to host a website available to the public. Users will be able to insert a message, select a decryption key, and will receive an encrypted message consisting of emojis to send to friends. The person receiving the message will be able to input the message, but will only decrypt given the correct key.

If time allows, we would like to develop an API that can be accessed from other websites. Users may have the option to encrypt their messages with themed emoji librarys. Additionally, we would like to implement a better encryption algorithm, so messages are harder to decrypt. 

### Motivation:

We found a good balance of utilizing the lessons learned throughout the course with an interesting coding problem. The combination of the two and working as a team will challenge and better us as young developers.

### Risks:
I.  Working on a team with varied operating systems: Team members systems (PC and MAC) may present some unknown challenges.  The application will require specific dependencies and an identical development environment which will take some coordination or may require a VirtualBox VM development environment to  collaborate.

II.  Tem Distribution: Our small team consists of members with different skill sets, backgrounds and locations.  We will all be working remotely.  Lack of Team cohesion, communication and ownership will increase risk to the project. 

III. Technical Complexity: The Encryption-Decryption Algorithm will require organic development and testing. In addition, Front End development and API deployment will require the application of new skills in a short amount of time.

V. Time (6 weeks): The limited time to work through the development cycle and address any potential problems presents significant risk.  It will be crucial that we honestly evaluate our skillsets and adequately define a project that can be completed in the allocated time. 
	
VI.  Scope and Feature Creep:  Failure to define the project and deviate from requirements and features will increase the risk of producing an incomplete project.

VII. Unknown Risk: All projects have unknown risks. We have to be aware of unknown problems that could arise and be generous in allocating time to complete tasks. In addition, we must be realistic of the time and complexity factors of the project. Unforeseen problems have the ability to drastically impact complexity and timeline. 

VII. Experience: We are emerging computer scientists with limited to no experience with a collaborative software project.  The project will require the application of new skills, and the time to complete tasks will generally be longer and more arduous than for a veteran developer.  Our ability to estimate complexity and timing has not been hardened with experience, so there’s a risk of underestimating.

### Mitigation Strategy for risks:


I.  Working on a team with varied operating systems:  If problems arise with the current MAC and PC collaboration we will utilize a VirtualBox VM.  CU Boulder Computer Science department has one available in the link below. https://foundation.cs.colorado.edu/vm/
 
II.  Team Distribution:  A slack Channel has been setup to allow for constant communication with the team. Weekly Zoom meetings will be utilized for collaboration, team interaction and team building . Trello’s Project Management tool will be utilized to assign ownership and track progress.  

III. Technical Complexity:  The team will develop a proof of principle algorithm for encryption/decryption in parallel to investigating the deployment strategy.  If the project is overly complex given the timeline, we will simplify the project.
While we will be working in parallel in front end and back end development, we will ensure that we complete the encryption functionality as a stand alone script early in the timeline.

V. Time (6 weeks):   The course syllabus provides a time-table with set deliverables that will help keep us on track. In addition to the syllabus we will utilize a gantt chart for project planning and tracking. 
	
VI.  Scope and Feature Creep:  The project will be flexible initially as we asses the technical complexity and timing. However, after the end of June we will have our project clearly defined and working toward completion.  We will limit any additional features if they impose risk on timeline.

VII. Unknown Risk:  We will assume 15% more time to complete given tasks to compensate for unknown risks. Additionally, we will be mindful of project functionality, timing and complexity.

VII. Experience: We will lean on advice and direction from an outside advisor (Professor) in regards to realistic project goals, complexity and timing.  The project will require the application of new skills which we will tackle through the class and independent learning.

### Development Method:


For this project, we've decided to use kanban as our development method.

We chose a kanban workflow because we wanted a development process that supports continuous delivery but we didn't want the rigidity of scrum. For example, we didn't want fixed length or locked-in sprints. Because of the nature and the timeline of the project, we want to be able to reprioritize work quickly.

To support our kanban process, we plan to use a Trello board to track work in progress. We want to institute work-in-progress limits, so every person only has one small-to-medium item in "Doing" at a time. We also plan to have standups regularly (at this point, 2x a week), where each member of the team will review work completed, work upcoming, and any blockers.

We plan to continuously deliver and deploy work, and we will set up continuous integration on our project.

###  Project tracking:

As mentioned above, we plan to use a [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/xqkROHN7/teamworldbot) for project tracking. We chose Trello as our project tracking software because it's easy to use, it supports a kanban workflow, and because members of our team already have experience with it.
