## Team World project for 3308

### Title:

Emojicryptor / Emojify

### Team:
James Covino, Cody Hegwer, Annie Lydens

### Vision statement:

Provide a web interface for users to send encrypted "emoji" messages to friends. At a bare minimum we will be able to host a website available to the public. Users will be able to insert a message, select a decryption key, and will receive an encrypted message consisting of emojis to send to friends. The person receiving the message will be able to input the message, but will only decrypt given the correct key.

If time allows, we would like to develop an API that can be accessed from other websites. Users may have the option to encrypt their messages with themed emoji librarys. Additionally, we would like to implement a better encryption algorithm, so messages are harder to decrypt. 

### Motivation:

We found a good balance of utilizing the lessons learned throughout the course with an interesting coding problem. The combination of the two and working as a team will challenge and better us as young developers.

### Risks:


### Mitigation Strategy for risks:


### Development Method:


For this project, we've decided to use kanban as our development method.

We chose a kanban workflow because we wanted a development process that supports continuous delivery but we didn't want the rigidity of scrum. For example, we didn't want fixed length or locked-in sprints. Because of the nature and the timeline of the project, we want to be able to reprioritize work quickly.

To support our kanban process, we plan to use a Trello board to track work in progress. We want to institute work-in-progress limits, so every person only has one small-to-medium item in "Doing" at a time. We also plan to have standups regularly (at this point, 2x a week), where each member of the team will review work completed, work upcoming, and any blockers.

We plan to continuously deliver and deploy work, and we will set up continuous integration on our project.

###  Project tracking:

As mentioned above, we plan to use a [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/xqkROHN7/teamworldbot) for project tracking. We chose Trello as our project tracking software because it's easy to use, it supports a kanban workflow, and because members of our team already have experience with it.
